Tasks:committing initial unfinished coding; easily 12 hours' work so far and did not sleep.  Very difficult assignment.
Start:Wed, 21 Jan 2015 (apologies - I did not git commit until Saturday of this week, kept bouncing between my laptop storage and server without committing, though I should also mention that my 'school weeks' tend to go friday night-sunday night as I work 65-75 hours most m-f and don't have much time for school on those days)

Tasks:six hours' total spent coding initial draft of assignment 3, part one, including use of external instructional videos to increase understanding
